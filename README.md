# hi, i’m keerthana

i’m a full-stack developer with a knack for AI/ML. 
i spend my days building things that work... and my nights fixing bugs i swear weren’t there before. 

## what i do(or atleast try to do) 
- develop full-stack apps that actually make sense (most of the time).  
- train AI to help me not lose my mind to bugs.  
- collaborate with anyone brave enough to share their code with me.
