# Hi, Iâ€™m [@HelloKeerthana](https://github.com/HelloKeerthana)

## About Me  
Iâ€™m a full-stack developer with a knack for AI/ML. I spend my days building things that work... and my nights fixing bugs I swear werenâ€™t there before.  
If you send me a broken commit, Iâ€™ll hunt you down.

## What I Do  
- Develop full-stack apps that actually make sense (most of the time).  
- Train AI to help me not lose my mind to bugs.  
- Collaborate with anyone brave enough to share their code with me.  

## Letâ€™s Connect
